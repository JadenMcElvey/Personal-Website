      <h1>Jaden McElvey</h1>
      <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;I've been serious about improving my photography
          since I turned 17. Photography as a pursuit is something I believe to be a
          worth every second. It feels great to do and it feels great when I get better
          so I began devoting more time to my photography. As a result I began working 
          towards a couple goals.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;One the quality of my work needed to improve. Photography
          is difficult and I needed to get better at it. My photos were mediocre but I knew 
          that I needed to put more effort in to make them great. I looked at other photographers
          to begin learning new techniques and what made photos work. This was invaluable and
          this change ment that my new primary goal was to always create better photography.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;Two I needed people to see my work. Prior to making this
          desicion I created photos and all they did was sit on my hard drive. I saw them 
          but almost nobody else ever saw my photos and I found that to be unacceptable.
          I wanted other people to see my work so I began posting my work where I knew other
          people would then be able to see them.
          <br><br>
          &emsp;&emsp;So overall I have the goals of all other photographers. I want to be 
          great at this craft and I want other people to see and appreciate my efforts.
          I also have a commitement to improving my work so that it is worthy of that appreciation.
          These are the goals I intend to pursue with this website.
